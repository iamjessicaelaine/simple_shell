# Project 0x17: C - Simple Shell
### A project by students at Holberton School in Tulsa, OK.

## About the Project:
For this project, we created a simple UNIX command interpreter in order to deepen our understanding of the C programming language which was used to code our simple shell. In addition to furthering our learning of C, we gained a broader perspective of how a shell functions.

*include valid description of shell here*

## Why is this project useful?
By reviewing our code present in this project, an individual can also gain a better understanding of how the shell that we all know and love functions on a basic level.

*describe what shell does and how to use it here*

## Getting Started
*include  example of how to use our shell/code here*
